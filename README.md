#Stylus Support for Brackets

**note**: Brackets 1.4 added support for Stylus, so there's no need for this extension.

There is now great [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) support in [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/). This extension is just a wrapper for that [mode](http://codemirror.net/mode/stylus/index.html) made by [Dmitry Kiselyov](https://github.com/dmitrykiselyov).

To install this extension download the zip an put the contents in the `src/extensions/dev` directory.
